# Resume Building Instructions for Kevin Gergely

## 1. Start With a Clear Goal

- Every resume must serve a specific purpose (e.g., IT Director role, CTO/VP IT positioning, technology leadership in healthcare or financial services).
- Maintain one master resume with everything included, then trim/tailor for each application.

## 2. Keep It Human and Authentic

- Avoid hype words, cliches, and corporate fluff.
- Write in a straightforward voice that reflects values: meaningful work, competence, leadership, achievement, independence.
- Represent strengths honestly.
  - Example: "Strong in enterprise infrastructure and HIPAA compliance, with growing expertise in cloud migration strategies."
  - Do not claim expertise unless you could confidently teach it or have led implementations.

## 3. Structure and Formatting

- Target 2 pages maximum (current resume is well-structured at this length).
- Use the following order:
  1. Header (Name, location, email, phone, LinkedIn)
  2. Executive Summary (leadership-focused, highlights IT Director experience in healthcare and financial services)
  3. Professional Experience (reverse chronological, emphasize impact and metrics)
  4. Education / Certifications
  5. Core Skills (grouped by categories)
  6. Key Projects (concrete examples of technical initiatives)
  7. Hobbies & Interests (optional, adds personality and community connection)

## 4. Writing Experience Bullets

- Use the formula: What you did + How you did it + Why it mattered.
- Example: "Implemented remote monitoring and device management platform, enhancing patching compliance and reducing downtime across 15 healthcare facilities."
- Focus on measurable outcomes: cost reductions, uptime percentages, compliance achievements, time savings.
- Quantify whenever possible: "reduced costs by 12%", "99.9% system availability", "30% faster resolution time".

## 5. Authentic Skills Positioning

- **Strongest areas**: IT infrastructure, Windows Server, Active Directory, HIPAA compliance, enterprise systems (ERP, EHR), team leadership, budget management, vendor negotiations.

- **Growing areas**: Cloud strategy, digital transformation, cybersecurity beyond compliance.
- **Leadership strength**: Building teams, managing multi-site operations, serving as liaison between IT and business units.

## 6. Tailoring Per Application

  - **Financial Services**: emphasize competence in audit readiness, risk management, business continuity, regulatory compliance.
  - **General Enterprise**: emphasize achievement through cost reduction, leadership in team development, independence in establishing IT governance.
  - **Smaller Organizations**: emphasize independence and hands-on competence across broad IT knowledge areas.
  - **Larger Organizations**: emphasize leadership at scale, strategic planning, and enterprise-wide achievements.
- Cut less-relevant projects when space is limited.

## 7. Show Core Values

## 9. Regular Maintenance

- Capture fresh wins: successful audits, major migrations, cost savings, new certifications.

- Keep metrics current and accurate.

## 10. Final Polish

- Proofread carefully. Avoid em dashes. Keep punctuation simple and clean.
- Ensure white space for readability.
- Use a modern, readable font (Calibri, Arial, or similar professional fonts).

## Writing Style Rules

- Never use em dashes (these are AI writing tells).
- Keep tone professional but personable, not overly corporate.
- Use simple punctuation: commas, periods, colons.
- Avoid buzzwords like "synergy," "rockstar," "ninja," "guru."

## Projects Worth Highlighting (Rotate Based on Relevance)

- Help Desk Implementation (process improvement, measurable results)
- Cloud Phone Migration (cost reduction, reliability improvement)
- Office 365 Migration (enterprise-scale change management)
- RMM/MDM Rollout (security and compliance enhancement)
- Asset Management System (operational efficiency)
- Hardware Refresh Lifecycle (proactive planning, cost management)

## Personal Touch

- The "Hobbies & Interests" section adds personality and shows well-roundedness:
  - Community service (volunteer firefighter) - demonstrates meaningful work outside career
  - Work-life balance (family time, three dogs) - shows groundedness
  - Stress management and reflection ("Wind Therapy" motorcycle rides) - demonstrates independence and self-awareness
- This section humanizes you and can be a conversation starter.
- Keep it for most applications, remove only for very formal/conservative organizations or when you need the space for more achievements.

## When to Expand Beyond 2 Pages

- Only if pursuing C-level roles (CIO, CTO) where extensive governance and strategic experience needs documentation.
- Even then, consider a separate "Leadership Portfolio" document rather than expanding the resume.

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Generic "responsible for" language (use action verbs instead).
- Listing technologies without context of how you used them.
- Leaving out quantifiable results.
- Inconsistent date formats or employment gaps without explanation.
- Overstating technical depth in areas where you have limited hands-on experience.

## Questions to Ask Before Sending

1. Does this resume clearly show I can handle the technical scope of this role?
2. Have I demonstrated leadership at the appropriate level?
3. Are my compliance/regulatory achievements visible (especially for healthcare and financial services)?
4. Do the metrics support my claims of cost reduction and reliability?
5. Does my personality come through without being unprofessional?
